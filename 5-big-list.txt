Language models (like GPT-3) are an interesting component with which to build tools for automating research.

List out ideas for a hackathon about building tools to automate research:
-Build a tool to automatically create research questionnaires and surveys
-Develop a tool to predict the outcome of research experiments
-Create a tool to automatically categorize research literature
-Build a tool to automatically generate research hypotheses
-Develop a tool that uses natural language processing to generate summaries of research
-Develop a tool to automatically generate research summaries from a corpus of documents
-Create a tool to automatically generate research plans from a set of research questions
-Develop a tool to compare and contrast different research papers
-Create a tool that uses machine learning to predict trends in research papers
-Build a tool that generates citations from research papers in the style of a particular journal
-Develop a tool to automatically generate a literature review on a research topic
